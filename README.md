# PentagoGame
Final project coded in C for CMSC 15200

The rules for the game of pentago can be found [here](http://www.creativedeployment.com/clients/mindtwister/strategy-guides/MTUSA_Pentago%20Rules-Strategy%20Guide%202015.pdf).

This project was useful as practice in building larger programs, using different data structures, and memory allocation. 

In the code, the game board can be stored in two different ways.  The first is a 2-dimensional array, which is fairly self-explanatory, and the other is as bits.  In the bits board representation, two bits are used to represent single squares and bitwise operations are used to handle the gameplay.

The game is played by running the Makefile in the shell.
